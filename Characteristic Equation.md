# Characteristic Equation
## Digital Electronics
**The equation determining the next state of a latch or flip-flop.**

Characteristic equations are expressed in terms of the *inputs* and the *present state*.
For example, the characteristic equation of a T flip-flop is $Q_{\text{next}}=T\bar{Q}+\bar{T}{Q}$.

Characteristic equations are used to generate a [[characteristic table]] or an [[excitation table]].
