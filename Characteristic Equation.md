# Characteristic Equation
## Linear differential equations
**The equation determining the solutions of a given nth-order differential equation.**

A characteristic equation can only be formed when the differential equation is *linear*, *homogeneous*, and contains *constant* coefficients.

A $n$th-order differential equation of the form
$$a_{n}y^{(n)}+a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+a_{1}y'+a_{0}y=0$$
has a *characteristic equation* of the form
$$a_{n}r^{n}+a_{n-1}r^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1}r+a_{0}=0$$
whose roots $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, $\dots$, $r_{n}$ form the *general solution* of the homogeneous differential equation.

## Digital electronics
**The equation determining the next state of a latch or flip-flop.**

Characteristic equations are expressed in terms of the *inputs* and the *present state*.
For example, the characteristic equation of a T flip-flop is $Q_{\text{next}}=T\bar{Q}+\bar{T}{Q}$.

Characteristic equations are used to generate a [[characteristic table]] or an [[excitation table]].
