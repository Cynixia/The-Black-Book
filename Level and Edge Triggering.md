# Level and Edge Triggering
*Level* and *edge* triggering refers to the type of stimulus that causes the outputs of a circuit or component to change.

Below is a timing diagram comparing the responses of a *level-triggered* D latch and an *positive-edge-triggered* D flip-flop.

## Level-triggered
**A circuit or component whose outputs change when the inputs are at a certain logic value.**

Level-triggered may also be called *level sensitive*.

## Edge-triggered
**A circuit or component whose outputs change at an input value transition.**

Edge-triggered may also be called *edge sensitive*. Edge-triggered components are either *negative-* or *positive-edge*-triggered, depending on if they change during a *falling* or *rising* transition.
