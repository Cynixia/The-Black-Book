# Universal Gate
**A logic gate that can implement any Boolean function.**

NAND and NOR gates are both universal gates. These two gates are composed of the [[Logical Operations|basic logic gates]] according to [[DeMorgan's Laws]].

This is notable as NAND gates require the least amount of transistors on CMOS chips.
