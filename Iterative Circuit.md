# Iterative Circuit
**A circuit that repeats an operation on the outputs of a previous execution of the operation.**

Iterative circuits are used to implement functions which require the same sub-function to be applied to a set of inputs. For example, arithmetic between two binary numbers requires the same operation on each of the bits.

A sub-functional block within the iterative circuit it known as a *cell*. An array of interconnected cells form an *iterative array*.
