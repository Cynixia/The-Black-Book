# Source Free RLC Circuit
**An RLC circuit without a source.**

The analysis of a *source free* RLC circuit is the same as finding the [[Second Order Circuit#Natural or transient response|natural or transient]] response of a general [[second order circuit]].

## Series RLC circuit
In a *series* RLC circuit, the second order differential equation is in terms of its *current*.
The [[damping]] *factor* and *natural frequency* are given by
$$\alpha=\frac{R}{2L}\qquad \omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

## Parallel RLC circuit
In a *parallel* RLC circuit, the differential equation is in terms of the *voltage* across the components. The *damping factor* and *natural frequency* are given by 
$$\alpha=\frac{1}{2RC}\qquad \omega_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$
