# Ohm's Law
**The current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.**

The constant of proportionality is the *resistance* measured in ohms ($\Omega$).
$$V=IR$$
The law assumes that the resistance is *constant* and independent of current.

Ohm's law can be extended into alternating current by converting the variables into [[phasor]] form and using [[impedance]] as the constant of proportionality.
$$\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{IZ}$$
