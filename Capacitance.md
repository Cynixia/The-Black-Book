# Capacitance
**The ability of an electrical conductor to store charge and thus oppose a change in voltage across it. **

There are two forms of capacitance, *self* and *mutual capacitance*. In general, "capacitance" refers to mutual capacitance.

## Self capacitance
**The amount of electric charge required to raise the electric potential of an isolated conductor by one unit.**
$$C=\frac{q}{V}$$
Any object that is capable of being electrically charged has *self capacitance*. In self capacitance, the potential difference is measured *relative* to a *reference*, typically ground.

## Mutual capacitance
**The ratio of the magnitude of electric charge held on either conductor to the potential difference between the conductors in a system of mutual capacitance.**

A system of mutual capacitance is found in parallel-plate [[Capacitor|capacitors]]. If the charges held on the plates are $+q$ and $-q$ and the voltage between them is $V$, the capacitance is also given by
$$C=\frac{q}{V}$$
