# Decibel
The *decibel*, $\text{dB}$, is a *relative* unit of measurement which expresses the ratio of two values of a [[Power and Root-Power Quantity|power or root-power quantity]] on a *logarithmic scale*. This ratio may be referred to as the *gain*, particularly when dealing with signals.

Two signals whose *levels* differ by one decibel have a *power ratio* of $10^{1/10}$ or a *root-power ratio* of $10^{1/20}$.

## Power quantities
For *power quantities*, their ratio in decibels is given by
$$\text{dB}_{\text{P}}=10\log_{10}\frac{P}{P_{0}}$$
where $P_{0}$ is the *reference* power.

The comparison between power quantities is used when comparing signals of *different waveforms*.

## Root-power quantities
For *root-power quantities*, their ratio in decibels is given by
$$\text{dB}_{\text{A}}=20\log_{10}\frac{A}{A_{0}}$$
Here, $A$ is used to refer to *amplitudes*.
