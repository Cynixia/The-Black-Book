# Maximum Average Power Transfer
**A two-terminal linear circuit delivers the maximum [[Average or Real Power|average power]] to a load when its impedance is equal to the [[Thevenin's and Norton's Theorem#Thevenin impedance|Thevenin impedance]] as seen from the load.**
$$\mathbf{Z}_{L}=\mathbf{Z}^{*}_{Th}$$
The value of this average power is
$$P_{\text{max}}=\frac{\vert\mathbf{V}_{\text{Th}}\vert^{2}}{8R_\text{Th}}$$
If the load is *purely resistive*, then the maximum average power transfer occurs when
$$R_{L}=\vert\mathbf{Z}_\text{Th}\vert$$
The value of the power transferred is calculated as [[Average or Real Power#^d8d1b7|normal]].
