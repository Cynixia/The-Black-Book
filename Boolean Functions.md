# Boolean Functions
**A binary variable function defined by a Boolean equation.**
$$L(D,X,A)=D\bar{X}+A$$
A Boolean equation contains *literals* and *terms* as operands of [[Logical Operations|logical operations]]. Boolean functions can be simplified by applying [[Boolean Algebra]].

Boolean functions are typically expressed in [[Standard Forms of a Boolean Function|standard form]].


## Literals
**A unique occurance of a variable** in a function. Complements are counted separately to non-complements.

The following equation contains $5$ literals.
$$B(A+D)+AC$$
## Terms
**An occurance of a literal or either a conjunction or disjunction of literals** in a function.

The previous equation contains $8$ terms; $A$ (counted twice), $B$, $C$, $D$, $A+D$, $AC$, $B(A+D)$.
