# AC Values
There are several quantities relating to [[Periodic Function|periodic functions]] that are useful to define.
- **Peak value** - the *maximum* value of the waveform, relative to the reference. ^6b76b1
- **Peak-to-peak value** - the *difference* between the positive and negative peaks.
- **Average value** - the average of the *instantaneous* values of a waveform over a *full cycle*.
- **Root mean square value** - the *equivalent* constant DC value required to dissipate the *same power* to a *resistive* load.

## Average value
The average value of a waveform is found with
$$X_{\text{avg}}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}x(t)\;dt$$
## Root mean square value
**The square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of values.**

For a continuous function,
$$X_{\text{RMS}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}[x(t)]^{2}\;dt}$$

For a [[Sinusoid|sinusoidal]] function,
$$X_{\text{RMS}}=\frac{X_m}{\sqrt{2}}$$
$X_m$ denotes the *peak value* of the function.
