# Inductance
**The tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the current flowing through it.**

Inductance is defined as the ratio of the *induced voltage* to the *rate of change* of the *current* causing it.

An electrical conductor will *induce* a magnetic field around it when a *changing* electric current is flowing through it, as described in [[Faraday's law of induction]]. This magnetic field in turn induces a *back EMF* that opposes the change in current according to [[Lenz's Law]].

Inductance depends on the *geometry* of the conductor and the *magnetic permeability* of nearby materials, such as the core.

A component designed specifically to add inductance is known as an [[inductor]] which usually consists of a coil of wire.
