# High Impendance
**A point in a circuit that allows very little current through per unit voltage applied.**

## Digital Electronics
In logic circuits a *high-impendance* or a *floating* output is one that is not at any defined logic level. It can be considered a third logic value and is often denoted with a $Z$.

High-impedance outputs can be considered as an open circuit in practice.
