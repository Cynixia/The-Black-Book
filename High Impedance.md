# High Impendance
**A point in a circuit that allows very little current through per unit voltage applied.**

Although not strictly based on the same concept, *high impedance* or Hi-Z derives its name from [[impedance]].

## Digital Electronics
In logic circuits a *high impendance* or a *floating* output is one that is not at any defined logic level. It can be considered a third logic value and is often denoted with a $Z$.

High-impedance outputs can be considered as an open circuit in practice.
