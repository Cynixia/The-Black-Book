# Linear Circuit
**A circuit whose output voltage and current are linear functions of its input voltage and current.**

A circuit is also linear if it follows the [[superposition]] principle.

Linear circuits consist of components whose values *do not* change depending on the voltages and current in the circuit. This property is known as being *linear time-invariant*.

Examples of *linear components* are
- Ideal resistors, capacitors, inductors
- Ideal non-saturated op-amps
- Amplifiers
- Differentiators
- Integrators
- Linear electronic filters
