# Comparison of the Laplace and Fourier Transform
Both the [[Laplace transform]] and the [[Fourier transform]] transform a function of a real variable, usually $t$ in the *time domain*, into a complex function.
The Fourier transform generates a complex function of a *real* variable, $\omega$, and the Laplace transform generates a complex function of a *complex* variable, $s$.
$$s=\sigma+i\omega$$
The Fourier transform is a *special case* of the Laplace transform, defined *only* on the $i\omega$ axis of the $s$ plane. However, the Laplace transform is typically defined as *one-sided* over $0<t<\infty$, whereas the Fourier transform is defined for all $t$. For a function $f(t)$ that is non-zero only for $t>0$,
$$F(\omega)=F(s)|_{s=i\omega}$$
The Laplace transform is applicable to *more functions* than the Fourier transform. A significant advantage is the application of the Laplace transform on  *integral* and *differential* equations into *polynomials*, allowing for the analysis of *dynamic systems* even with *initial condition* constraints.

Fourier transforms are particularly useful for *steady systems*, and provide insight into the frequency characteristics of the system.
