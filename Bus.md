# Bus
## Digital Electronics
**A vector signal of a group of single-bit variables or the bits of a multi-bit variable.**

A set of signals such as $\{A_{3}, A_{2}, A_{1}, A_{0}\}$ can be expressed as a *bus* $A(3:0)$. Buses are graphically represented using thicker lines and an integer to specify size.
