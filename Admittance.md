# Admittance
**The reciprocal of [[impedance]].**

*Admittance*, $\mathbf{Y}$, is a measure of the ease in which current flows. It is measured in *siemens* ($\text{S}$). Like impedance, it is a [[complex number]].
$$\mathbf{Y}=\frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}}=\frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{V}}$$
Admittance is composed of *conductance*, $G$, and *susceptance*, $B$, both also measured in siemens, and is expressed as
$$\mathbf{Y}=G+jB$$
## Series combination
The total admittance of a series of components is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their admittances.
$$\mathbf{Y}_\text{eq}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\mathbf{Y}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathbf{Y}_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{\mathbf{Y}_{n}}}$$

## Parallel combination
The total admittance of parallel components is the sum of their individual admittances.
$$\mathbf{Y}_{\text{eq}}=\mathbf{Y}_{1}+\mathbf{Y}_{2}+\cdots+\mathbf{Y}_{n}$$
