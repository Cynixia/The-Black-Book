# Duality
**A one-to-one relation of different concepts, theorems, or mathematical structures, often through an [[involution]] operation.**

## Boolean algebra
In Boolean algebra, the *dual* of an algebraic expression is obtained by the interchanging of the AND and the OR operators and HIGH (1) and LOW (0) values.

### Example
$$\begin{flalign}
&F=XY+\bar{X}Z+YZ&\\
&F_{dual}=(X+Y)(\bar{X}+Z)(Y+Z)
\end{flalign}$$

## Electrical circuits
Electrical terms can be associated into *dual* pairs by the interchanging of voltage and current in their expressions. Below is a partial list of dual pairs:
- Voltage - current
- Parallel - series topology
- Voltage division - current division
- Impedance - admittance
	- Resistance - conductance
	- Reactance - susceptance
- Capacitance - inductance
- Kirchhoff's voltage law - Kirchhoff's current law
- [[Thevenin's and Norton's Theorem|Thevenin's theorem]] - [[Thevenin's and Norton's Theorem|Norton's theorem]]

### Example
For a [[capacitor]] and an [[inductor]],
$$i_{C}=C \frac{d\;v_{C}}{dt}\Longleftrightarrow v_{L}=L \frac{d\;i_{L}}{dt}$$
