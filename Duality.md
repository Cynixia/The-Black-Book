# Duality
**A one-to-one relation of different concepts, theorems, or mathematical structures, often through an [[involution]] operation.**

## Boolean Algebra
In Boolean algebra, the *dual* of an algebraic expression is obtained by the interchanging of the AND and the OR operatiors and HIGH (1) and LOW (0) values.

### Example
$$\begin{flalign}
&F=XY+\bar{X}Z+YZ&\\
&F_{dual}=(X+Y)(\bar{X}+Z)(Y+Z)
\end{flalign}$$
