# Autotransformer
**A type of [[transformer]] with only one winding.**

An *autotransformer* is smaller and lighter than an equivalent transformer and can transfer more [[Complex Power#Apparent power|apparent power]]. However, it is not capable of *electrical isolation*.

Autotransformers have taps at various positions on the winding to set the winding ratio to the desired number.

An autotransformer has [[Inductance#Mutual inductance|magnetically coupled]] and conductively coupled windings, and so the [[Transfer Function|transfer functions]] are different to those from a typical transformer.

In a *step-down* transformer,
$$\frac{v_{S}}{v_{P}}=\frac{N_{S}}{N_{P}+N_{S}}\qquad\frac{i_{S}}{i_{P}}=\frac{N_{P}+N_{S}}{N_{S}}=1+\frac{N_{P}}{N_{S}}$$

In a *step-up* transformer,
$$\frac{v_{S}}{v_{P}}=\frac{N_{P}+N_{S}}{N_{P}}=1+\frac{N_{S}}{N_{P}}\qquad\frac{i_{S}}{i_{P}}=\frac{N_{P}}{N_{P}+N_{S}}$$
