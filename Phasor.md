# Phasor
**A [[complex number]] representing a [[Sinusoid|sinusoidal function]].**
$$\begin{align*}
v(t)=V_{m}\sin(\omega t)&\Longleftrightarrow\mathbf{V}=V_{m}\angle 0^{\circ}\\
v(t)=V_{m}\sin(\omega t+\phi)&\Longleftrightarrow\mathbf{V}=V_{m}\angle \phi^{\circ}
\end{align*}$$
The more common expression of a phasor is in [[Polar Form of a Complex Number|polar form]]. Phasors have a *magnitude* equal to the *amplitude* of the sinusoid and an *argument* equal to the [[phase]].
$$\begin{align*}
|\mathbf{V}|&=V_{m} \\
\text{arg}(\mathbf{V})&=\phi
\end{align*}$$

Phasors exists in the *phasor* or *frequency* domain as opposed to the time domain.

Note that phasors contain *no information* about the *frequency* nor any information about whether the sinusoid is in *sine* or *cosine* form. Thus, using phasors requires *consistency* relative to a reference, such as by setting sine as the zero phase reference.

Any numerical calculations using phasors only apply for the frequency substituted into the equations.
