# Don't Care Condition
**A particular [[Boolean Functions|Boolean function]] condition, input or output, which is unspecified.**

Typically an output condition is *unspecified* because its input condition *never occurs*.

An example of an input condition that never occurs are the input combinations $1010$ to $1111$ in binary coded decimal.

Don't care conditions are denoted with "X"s in truth tables and [[Karnaugh Map|K-maps]].
