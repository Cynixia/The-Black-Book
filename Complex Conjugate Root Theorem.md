# Complex Conjugate Root Theorem
**If $P$ is a single-variable polynomial with real coefficients and a [[complex number]] $z$ is a root, then its [[complex conjugate]] $\bar{z}$ is also a root.**

This implies that if the *degree* of the real polynomial is *odd*, then it must have *at least one* real root.
