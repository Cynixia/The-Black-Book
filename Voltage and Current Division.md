# Voltage and Current Division
As the voltage across and the current through a component is related to its [[impedance]] by [[Ohm's law]], the following situations allows for their direct calculation.

## Voltage division

$$\mathbf{V}_{n}=\mathbf{V}\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{n}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\text{eq}}}$$
## Current division

$$\mathbf{I}_{n}=I\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{\text{eq}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{n}}$$
