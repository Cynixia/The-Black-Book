# State Diagram
**A diagram describing the behaviour of a system as a set of states and the transitions between them.**

## Finite state machines
### Mealy machine
For a [[Finite State Machine#Mealy machine|Mealy machine]], outputs are labelled on a transition with the inputs as "j/k" with *j* is the input and *k* is the output.

### Moore machine
For a [[Finite State Machine#Moore machine|Moore machine]], outputs are labelled on its associated state.
