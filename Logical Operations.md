# Logical Operations
The three basic logical operations in [[Boolean algebra]] are
- Conjunction - AND
- Disjunction - OR
- Negation - NOT

Logical operations are idealised as logic gates.

## Conjunction
The *conjunction* or *and* of a set of operands is true if both its operands are true.
$$X\wedge Y=X\cdot Y=XY$$ The corresponding logic gate is the AND gate.

## Disjunction
The *disjunction* or *or* of a set of operands is true if any of its operands are true.
$$X\vee Y=X+Y$$
The corresponding logic gate is the OR gate.

## Negation
The *negation* or *not* of an operand is true if the operand is false. Negating a variable gives its *complement*.
$$\neg X=\bar{X}=X'$$
The corresponding logic gate is the NOT gate or inverter.
