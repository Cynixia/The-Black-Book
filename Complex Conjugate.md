## Complex Conjugate
The *complex conjugate* of a complex number is the number with real and imaginary parts equal in magnitude but *opposite* in *sign*.
$$\bar{z}=z^*=x-iy=r\angle{-\phi}$$
Conjugation is *distributive* over addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
$$\begin{align*} \overline{z+w}&=\bar{z}+\bar{w} \\
\overline{z-w}&=\bar{z}-\bar{w} \\
\overline{zw}&=\bar{z}\;\bar{w} \\
\overline{\frac{z}{w}}&=\frac{\bar{z}}{\bar{w}}
\end{align*}$$
Conjugation is *commutative* under composition with exponentiation to integer powers, the exponential function, and the natural logarithm.

A complex number and its complex conjugate are used in the [[complex conjugate root theorem]].

Conjugation is also an [[involution]].
